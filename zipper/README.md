Hello there,this is a simple Compression tool I built with a little help from youtube tutorials yk?

Just use it as shown:

`source(File to be compressed)` `target(File that was compressed)`

ie dir1 compressed-dir1

This is very simple to understand and you have the freedom to rename the file as you wish once its been compressed.
