Hello there,this is a simple Compression tool I built with a little help from youtube tutorials yk?

Just use it as shown:

`source(File to be compressed)` `target(File that was compressed)`

ie dir1 compressed-dir1

Also I should just state that to actually use my CLI tool you have to compile the rust code by running:

`git clone <This repo link>`

`cd no-zipper`

`cargo run`


This is very simple to understand and you have the freedom to rename the file as you wish once its been compressed.
