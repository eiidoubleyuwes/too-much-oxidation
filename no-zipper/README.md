Hello there,this is a simple Decompression tool I built,it is supposed to be complimetary with the zipping tool I made.

Usage:

`source(File to be decompressed)`

Also I should just state that to actually use my CLI tool you have to compile the rust code by running:

`git clone <This repo link>`

`cd no-zipper`

`cargo run`


The ouput file should be the same name as the compressed file if I understood my logic properly
